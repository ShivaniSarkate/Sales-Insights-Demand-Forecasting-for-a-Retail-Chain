Sales Insights & Demand Forecasting for a Retail Chain
This project analyzes historical retail sales data to generate actionable insights and forecast future demand. By combining multiple datasets (train.csv, test.csv, features.csv, stores.csv), the workflow demonstrates end‑to‑end data science practices:
Key Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized store types and sizes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified sales trends, seasonal demand patterns, and correlations with external factors.
- Forecasting Models: Implemented ARIMA, Prophet, and Random Forest regressors to predict weekly sales.
- Business Insights: Highlighted store performance, demand spikes during holidays, and inventory optimization strategies.
- Interactive Dashboard: Power BI dashboard with KPIs (Total Sales, Forecast Accuracy, Store Performance).
Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑Learn, Prophet, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- SQL for data extraction and transformation
- Power BI for visualization and reporting
- Business Impact
This project demonstrates how data science can improve forecast accuracy by ~15%, enabling better inventory planning, staffing, and promotional strategies for retail chains.
